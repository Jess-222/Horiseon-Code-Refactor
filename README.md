# **Horiseon-Code-Refactor**


## **The Repository**

This repository (Horiseon-Code_Refactor) was built to refactor HTML to use semantic tags and consolidate CSS in order to follow accessibility standards.


## **User Story**

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## **Acceptance Criteria**

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
